ETH remained well bid above the&nbsp;$1,710 level&nbsp;and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>\n<p>The last swing low was formed near $1,173 before there was an upward move. The price climbed above the $1,800 resistance level. There was a break above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,942 high to $1,713 low.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p>However, the price failed to clear the $1,850 resistance zone. It seems like the price failed to clear the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,942 high to $1,713 low.</p>\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17.png" rel="noopener"><img src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17.png" srcset="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17.png 1944w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17-460x272.png 460w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17-860x508.png 860w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17-768x454.png 768w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17-1536x908.png 1536w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17-750x443.png 750w, https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ethereum-17-1140x674.png 1140w" alt="Ethereum"></a></p>\n<pre>Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com</pre>\n<p>Ether is currently declining and trading below $1,800. There is also a key rising channel forming with support near $1,775 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD. If there is a downside break below the channel support, there is a risk of a drop towards the $1,710 support. Any more losses below $1,700 may possibly open the doors for a larger decline towards $1,550 and $1,500.</p>\n<div></div>\n<h2>Fresh Rally in Ether (ETH)?</h2>\n<p>If Ethereum stays above the channel support or $1,700, it could attempt a&nbsp;fresh increase. An initial resistance on the upside is near the $1,820 level.</p>\n<p>The first key resistance is near the $1,850 and $1,855 levels. If ether price breaks the $1,850 resistance, there are high chances of a strong increase in the coming sessions. The next key resistance sits near the $1,920 and $1,950 levels.</p>\n<p>Technical Indicators</p>\n<div></div>\n<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone.</p>\n<p>4 hours RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now just below the 50 level.</p>\n<p>Major Support Level – $1,710</p>\n<p>Major Resistance Level – $1,850</p>\n<p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-must-hold-1700/" rel="noopener">News Source</a></p>\n',

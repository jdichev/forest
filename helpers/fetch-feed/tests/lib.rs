                                            startup Revolut</a> </strong>has confirmed it was hit by a highly targeted cyberattack that allowed
                                    hackers to
                                    access the personal details of tens of thousands of customers.</p>
                                <p>Revolut spokesperson Michael Bodansky told TechCrunch that an “unauthorized third party obtained access to
                                    the details of a small percentage (0.16%) of our customers for a short period of time.” Revolut discovered
                                    the malicious access late on September 10 and isolated the attack by the following morning.</p>
                                <p>“We immediately identified and isolated the attack to effectively limit its impact and have contacted those
                                    customers affected,” Bodansky said. “Customers who have not received an email have not been impacted.”</p>
                                <p>Revolut, which has a banking license in Lithuania, wouldn’t say exactly how many customers were affected. Its
                                    website says the company has approximately 20 million customers; 0.16% would translate to about 32,000
                                    customers. However, according to Revolut’s <a

                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleeping Computer</a>, the company says 50,150 customers were impacted by
                                    the breach, including 20,687 customers in the European Economic Area and 379 Lithuanian citizens.

                                <p>Revolut also declined to say what types of data were accessed but told TechCrunch that no funds were accessed
                                    or stolen in the incident. In <a

                                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">a message sent to affected customers</a> posted to Reddit, the company
                                    said that “no card details, PINs or passwords were accessed.” However, the breach disclosure states that
                                    hackers likely accessed partial card payment data, along with customers’ names, addresses, email addresses
                                    and phone numbers.</p>
                                <p>The disclosure states that the threat actor used social engineering methods to gain access to the Revolut
                                    database, which typically involves persuading an employee to hand over sensitive information such as their
                                    password. This has become a popular tactic in recent attacks against a number of well-known companies,

                                    asking for login data or access codes.</p>
                                <p>As a precaution, Revolut has also formed a dedicated team tasked with monitoring customer accounts to make
